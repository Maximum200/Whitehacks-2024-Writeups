Unfortunately, this time our searches weren't as useful. According to my teammates, the location is at Sembawang park. Since we can see cars in the distance and a fork in the footpath, we can narrow it down further to car parks in the vicinity of Sembawang park.

With a bit of guessing, we managed to find the flag.

Flag: WH2024{TUAHROAD} (at least, I hope this is the right one? We couldnâ€™t manage to verify it again)
